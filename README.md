# Wright's Intersectionality Wheel

This intersectionality wheel has been developed to help you think about your EDI approach to your work in a more intersectional way.

The wheel helps users to resist only thinking of protected characteristics in a siloed way, but instead consider different kinds of challenges that individuals face when they belong to more than one underrepresented or disadvantaged group.

For example, how would the challenges be different for a white woman compared to a woman of colour?

How would experiences need to be tailored for someone who has both a disability and comes from a low socio-economic background?

The wheel can be kept by your desk space and referred to when you are trying to inclusively design an event, conference, meeting, lesson, workshop, learning resource or teaching course.

The wheel works best when printed on white card.

There is a colour version and a black and white version for neurodivergent needs.

This is a free resource for anyone wanting to approach their activities with an EDI and intersectional lense.
